Endian: Direction of a vector.
Little Endian: least significant bit has given lower index. ex: [3:0].
Big Endian: least significant bit has given higher index. ex: [0:3].

Bitwise operator and logical operator.
If a vector has a non-zero value, it is considered as true. (1)
If a vector has a zero value, it is considered as true. (0)
ex: for, out_or_logical = a || b, out_or_logical would be a 1 bit value which would be 1 for any non-zero values of a and b but,  
for, out_or_bitwise = a | b, if a is 10001000 and b is 10010001, out_or_bitwise would be a 8-bit vector of value 10011001.
ex: for a = 0011, ~a = 1100 and !a = 0.
